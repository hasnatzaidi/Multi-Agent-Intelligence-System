# Multi-Agent-Intelligence-System
Design and implement a minimal multi-agent system in which a Coordinator (Manager)  agent orchestrates three specialized worker agents to answer user questions. The  solution should demonstrate clear role separation, inter-agent coordination, structured  memory, and adaptive decision-making. 

**System Architecture**
🎯 **Coordinator Agent (Manager)**

Orchestrates the entire process
Analyzes questions to determine which agents to engage
Creates execution plans and coordinates timing
Synthesizes final responses from all agent contributions
Manages system memory and context

👥 **Three Specialized Worker Agents:**

Research Agent: Specializes in factual information, data analysis, and knowledge retrieval
Analysis Agent: Focuses on logical reasoning, pattern recognition, and critical analysis
Creative Agent: Generates innovative solutions and alternative perspectives

**Key Features Demonstrated**
🔄 **Inter-Agent Coordination**

Sequential execution with dependency management
Agents can build upon each other's work
Coordinator manages timing and information flow

🧠 **Structured Memory System**

Conversation history tracking
Pattern recognition across interactions
Context extraction for better decision-making

⚙️ **Adaptive Decision-Making**

Question analysis determines which agents to engage
Dynamic execution planning based on question complexity
Context-aware responses that improve over time

🎨 **Role Separation**

Each agent has distinct expertise and knowledge domains
Clear separation of concerns (research vs analysis vs creativity)
Specialized processing methods for each agent type
