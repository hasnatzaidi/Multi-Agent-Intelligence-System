# Multi-Agent-Intelligence-System
Design and implement a minimal multi-agent system in which a Coordinator (Manager)  agent orchestrates three specialized worker agents to answer user questions. The  solution should demonstrate clear role separation, inter-agent coordination, structured  memory, and adaptive decision-making. 

**System Architecture**

🎯 **Coordinator Agent (Manager)**

Orchestrates the entire process
Analyzes questions to determine which agents to engage
Creates execution plans and coordinates timing
Synthesizes final responses from all agent contributions
Manages system memory and context

👥 **Three Specialized Worker Agents:**

Research Agent: Specializes in factual information, data analysis, and knowledge retrieval
Analysis Agent: Focuses on logical reasoning, pattern recognition, and critical analysis
Creative Agent: Generates innovative solutions and alternative perspectives

**Key Features Demonstrated**

🔄 **Inter-Agent Coordination**

Sequential execution with dependency management
Agents can build upon each other's work
Coordinator manages timing and information flow

🧠 **Structured Memory System**

Conversation history tracking
Pattern recognition across interactions
Context extraction for better decision-making

⚙️ **Adaptive Decision-Making**

Question analysis determines which agents to engage
Dynamic execution planning based on question complexity
Context-aware responses that improve over time


🎨 **Role Separation**

Each agent has distinct expertise and knowledge domains
Clear separation of concerns (research vs analysis vs creativity)
Specialized processing methods for each agent type

**How to Use**

Enter any question in the input field
Watch as the Coordinator analyzes and plans the approach
See each specialized agent work on different aspects
View the final synthesized response combining all perspectives
Check the memory section to see how the system learns from interactions

The system handles various question types intelligently - factual queries engage the Research Agent more heavily, analytical questions emphasize the Analysis Agent, and creative challenges leverage the Creative Agent's capabilities. The Coordinator ensures all perspectives are properly integrated into a comprehensive response.
